= Netrics Local Dashboard

Local (LAN) dashboard server(s) for extended reporting, measurement and control of Netrics experimentation.

This repository provides the source code behind the Netrics local dashboard.
Basic orchestration for the local dashboard is also provided, via Docker,
as well as for its required https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server[ndt-server].

Docker images are stored in Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/chicagocdac/netrics-dashboard[netrics-dashboard] and
https://hub.docker.com/r/chicagocdac/ndt-server[ndt-server].


== Installation

To manually provision a network-connected Netrics device, a bootstrapping script
is maintained under link:./bin/netrics-docker-run[bin/netrics-docker-run].

This script is intended for execution from another network-connected device
(_e.g._ your laptop), and assumes that the Netrics device is accessible at `netrics.local`.

To execute the script and provision your Netrics device without cloning this repository:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicago-cdac/netrics-dash/main/bin/netrics-docker-run | sh
```

Or, from a repository clone:

```sh
./bin/netrics-docker-run
```

The local dashboard is then accessible at http://netrics.local/.


== Development

=== Background

As the target artifact of development is the Docker image, the Docker CLI is the
development environment's core requirement.

All development and orchestration tasks are defined (akin to the `Makefile`)
by the `manage.py` Python module, which is executed by the `manage` command
(see https://github.com/dssg/argcmdr[argcmdr]).

Development environment requirements beyond the above are therefore slim-to-none.
Nonetheless, a Python virtual environment is recommended, (if relatively unnecessary):

* https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv] (and its extensions) remain among the
most powerful development tools by which to ensure Python versioning and library
requirements are met.
* Alternatively, self-management will always do the trick, _e.g._:
+
[source,sh]
----
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
----

=== Set-up

The development and orchestration environment may be configured and verified
via the guided set-up script link:./develop[develop]:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./develop 
(install) begin 

(python-3.7.0) check passed ✓ 

(cli) install? 
1) yes, install { pip install -r requirement/develop.txt }
2) no, ignore
#? 
----

=== Develop → Build → Deploy

All development and orchestration tasks may be managed via the `manage` command.

Get started serving the local dashboard from the cloned repository's source:

[source,sh]
----
manage serve
----

Explore management tasks via the `--help` flag, _e.g._:

[source,sh]
----
manage --help
----

and:

[source,sh]
----
manage serve --help
----

Preview tasks' operations via `--dry-run` (or `-d`):

[source,sh]
----
manage --dry-run serve
----

And view these as they're executed via `--show` (or `-s`):

[source,sh]
----
manage --show serve
----
